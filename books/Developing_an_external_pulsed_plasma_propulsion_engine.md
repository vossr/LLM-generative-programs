### Plasma Behavior: Understanding the Fundamentals of Plasma Particles and Magnetic Field Interactions
The behavior of plasmas is governed by the fundamental principles of plasma physics, which are essential to understanding the technology of external pulsed plasma propulsion engines. In this section, we will cover the basic behavior of plasmas, including the properties of plasma particles, the behavior of plasma in magnetic fields, and the effects of electric and magnetic fields on plasma.

Properties of Plasma Particles

Plasma particles can be broadly classified into two categories: ions and electrons. Ions are charged particles that are positively or negatively charged, while electrons are negatively charged particles. The properties of plasma particles are determined by their charge, mass, and temperature.

Ions and electrons have different behaviors in plasmas due to their differing masses and charges. Ions are much heavier than electrons and have a much smaller charge-to-mass ratio, which means that they are slower and more massive than electrons. This difference in behavior is important in understanding the behavior of plasmas in magnetic fields, as we will see later.

Behavior of Plasma in Magnetic Fields

Plasmas can be confined and manipulated using magnetic fields, which are created by electric currents. The behavior of plasma in magnetic fields is determined by the Lorentz force, which is the force experienced by a charged particle in a magnetic field. The Lorentz force is given by the equation:

F = q(E + v x B)

where F is the force, q is the charge of the particle, E is the electric field, v is the velocity of the particle, and B is the magnetic field.

The behavior of plasma in magnetic fields is important in understanding the operation of external pulsed plasma propulsion engines, which use magnetic fields to confine and accelerate plasma. The magnetic fields can be used to control the behavior of the plasma and to extract energy from it.

Effects of Electric and Magnetic Fields on Plasma

Electric and magnetic fields have a significant impact on the behavior of plasmas. Electric fields can be used to accelerate or decelerate plasma particles, while magnetic fields can be used to confine and manipulate the plasma. The combination of electric and magnetic fields can be used to control the behavior of plasmas and to extract energy from them.

The effects of electric and magnetic fields on plasma can be understood by studying the behavior of individual plasma particles. For example, the motion of ions and electrons in a magnetic field can be described using the Lorentz force equation. The equation shows that the motion of plasma particles is determined by the strength and direction of the magnetic field, as well as the charge and velocity of the particles.

In conclusion, the behavior of plasmas is determined by the fundamental principles of plasma physics, including the properties of plasma particles, the behavior of plasma in magnetic fields, and the effects of electric and magnetic fields on plasma. Understanding these principles is essential to developing an external pulsed plasma propulsion engine that is efficient, reliable, and safe.

The exhaust is used to expel the plasma out of the back of the spacecraft.

The electrostatic forces are created by applying a high voltage difference between the plasma and the spacecraft. This creates an electric field that accelerates the charged particles in the plasma, causing the plasma to move in the direction of the electric field. By carefully controlling the timing and amplitude of the pulses, the direction of the plasma jet can be controlled, allowing for precise maneuvering of the spacecraft.

Another advantage of electrostatic pulsed plasma propulsion is its high thrust-to-power ratio. This means that for a given amount of power, the system can produce a much higher thrust than a traditional chemical propulsion system. This is because the electrostatic forces are much stronger than the forces created by chemical reactions.

Limitations

### Explanation of Electromagnetic Pulsed Plasma Propulsion and How it Works
This type of system is based on the principle of electromagnetic induction, where an electric current is generated in a coil when it is exposed to a changing magnetic field.

In an electromagnetic pulsed plasma propulsion system, a high-frequency electromagnetic field is generated in a coil to ionize and accelerate the plasma. The accelerated plasma is then expelled out of the back of the engine, creating thrust.

This is because electromagnetic fields can be easily controlled and focused, allowing for precise manipulation of the plasma and maximization of the thrust. Additionally, electromagnetic systems can be designed to operate at a lower frequency than electrostatic systems, which can reduce the risk of electrostatic discharge and improve the overall stability of the system.

However, there are also some limitations to electromagnetic systems. One of the main limitations is the difficulty in achieving a high level of confinement, which can lead to a loss of plasma and a reduction in the overall efficiency of the system. This can be particularly challenging in long-duration missions, where the plasma may be subject to a variety of instabilities and losses. Additionally, electromagnetic systems can be more complex and difficult to design and operate than other types of systems, which can increase the cost and complexity of the mission.

Another limitation of electromagnetic systems is the difficulty in achieving a high level of specific impulse, which is a measure of the efficiency of the propulsion system. Specific impulse is a measure of the amount of thrust produced by a unit of propellant, and it is typically measured in seconds. Electromagnetic systems have a lower specific impulse than other types of systems, such as electrostatic systems, which can limit their usefulness for certain types of missions.

Despite these limitations, electromagnetic systems have the potential to be highly effective for certain types of missions, particularly those that require a high level of efficiency and a long duration. For example, electromagnetic systems could be used to propel a spacecraft over long distances, where the high efficiency of the system would be particularly beneficial. Additionally, the ability of electromagnetic systems to operate at a lower frequency than other types of systems could make them more suitable for certain types of missions, such as those that require a high level of stability and control.
